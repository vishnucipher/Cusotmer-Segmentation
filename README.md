# Market Segmentation in Insurance

### Objective  :
This case requires to develop a customer segmentation to give recommendations like saving plans, loans, wealth management, etc. on target customer groups.

 Based on the customers features Ml model will recommends, saving plans, loans ,wealth....

 ### Features Description

```
BALANCE_FREQUENCY:  How often different amounts of money(balances) appear in the dataset of bank accounts.

ONEOFF_PURCHASE: how much money or how many items customers bought in a single transaction.

INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES: shows how much money or how many items customers bought using installment payments (paying in parts over time).

CASH_ADVANCE: refers to the amount of cash that customers withdraw or borrow from their credit account.

CREDIT_LIMIT: is the maximum amount of money a customer can borrow on their credit account.

PURCHASES_FREQUENCY: tells us how often(many times or frequently) customers buy stuff.

ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY:tells us how often customers make single, one-time purchases.

PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY: shows how often customers make purchases using installment payments.

CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY: shows how often customers take out cash advances from their credit account.

CASH_ADVANCE_TRX: represents the number of transactions where customers took out cash advances from their credit account.

PURCHASES_TRX: stands for the number of transactions where customers made purchases.

PAYMENTS: is the money customers have paid to their credit card.

MINIMUM_PAYMENTS: is the smallest amount of money customers need to pay on their credit card each month.

PRC_FULL_PAYMENT: shows the percentage of the credit card balance that customers pay off completely each month.
```

### Data Description : 
The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.
### Data :  
Use the below link to download the Data Set:[here](https://github.com/pik1989/MarketSegmentation/blob/main/Clustered_Customer_Data.csv) 
### Algorithms used :  
In this dataset i've used five clustering algorithm to perform segmentation.These algorithms are given below.
- [K-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
### Final Model  :
We have created a Flask Application based on this clustering technique, where we are taking the customer details & identifying which cluster the custoemr belongs to.
